<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Low and middle income countries (LMIC) are particularly exposed to
the adverse effects of climate change and this vulnerability is expected
to worsen in the coming decades <span class="citation"
data-cites="bathiany18 hoegh2018impacts carleton22"></span>. Since
international trade can be a crucial tool for economic development <span
class="citation" data-cites="WDR2020"></span>, it is important to
understand how climate change affects trading sectors in LMIC.</p>
<p>In this paper, we study how changes in weather conditions impact
firm-level exports in 9 low and middle income economies. Relative to
high income countries, LMIC tend to have fewer exporters and a lower
concentration of exports at the top of the firm-size distribution, as
documented by <span class="citation" data-cites="Fernandes2016"></span>.
These stylized facts show the existence of important differences in the
structure of exports between high and poor economies, which can in turn
explain how environmental conditions affect differently a firm’s exports
in LMIC.</p>
<p>We study the impact of variations in weather conditions, measured by
temperatures and precipitations, on several export outcomes at the
firm-level. Our first goal is to assess how heterogeneous exporters cope
differently when facing the same changes in weather conditions. To guide
our analysis, we hypothesize that firm size reduces the potentially
negative effect of weather shocks on exports.</p>
<p>There are at least four main channels to support this hypothesis on
differential adaptation. First, the attenuation of climate shocks in the
agricultural sector is determined by the ability to irrigate land as
well as many other techniques, requiring innovation and investment. As
these techniques are not available to all firms <span class="citation"
data-cites="jones2019factor"></span>, only the largest firms are
expected to have sufficient funds to innovate and acquire these
technologies. Second, the largest exporters tend to have a high share of
imported inputs relative to domestic ones <span class="citation"
data-cites="amiti2014importers"></span>, which straightforwardly leads
firms’ output to be less sensitive to local weather shocks <span
class="citation" data-cites="Garcia2019"></span>. In all, firm size is
thus expected to attenuate the detrimental effect of climate change on
economic activity, here firm-exports. Third, numerous evidence point
that labor productivity is negatively affected by temperatures <span
class="citation"
data-cites="heal2016reflections somanathan_impact_2021"></span>. Since
capital to labor ratios tend to be increasing in exporter size <span
class="citation" data-cites="bernard2007firms Forslid2011"></span>, the
largest firms are again expected to be less affected by temperatures.
Finally, weather shocks have contrasting effects across skilled and
unskilled workers, notably since ventilation and air-conditioning
systems allow adaptation. Since these technologies are more likely to be
available to skilled workers and as the largest exporters tend to have a
lower share of unskilled workers <span class="citation"
data-cites="bernard2007firms"></span>, these firms are expected to be
less exposed to weather variations. The first goal of our paper is to
document this heterogeneous firm-level impact.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we take advantage of a database covering
exporter-level customs transactions in low- and middle-income countries
between 1993 and 2013. These data are a subset from the Export Dynamics
Database introduced by <span class="citation"
data-cites="Fernandes2016"></span>, available at this level of
disaggregation only for some countries, including Burkina Faso,
Guatemala, Jordan, Mexico, Malawi, Peru, Senegal, Uruguay and Yemen.
Within each country, data cover all export transactions at firm-HS6
product - destination country -year dimension. We combine it with
weather data providing measures of local temperatures and
precipitations.</p>
<p>The second goal of this paper is to highlight the aggregate
consequences of the firm-level responses. Assuming weather shocks have a
negative effect on exports that is dampended for the largest firms, if
those firms represent a large share of a country’s exports, then the
aggregate elasticity of exports to weather measures should be low. On
the contrary, if large exporters account for a low share of aggregate
exports then this aggregate elasticity is expected to be large and
negative. The aggregate elasticity of exports to past and future weather
shocks, which averages firm-level elasticities depending on their share
in total exports, will thus vary depending on firm-level elasticities
and on firm-size distribution. We exploit those variations to study the
consequences for a country’s exports in the future. This is the second
analytical part of the paper.</p>
<p>In the first part, we find that year-to-year fluctuations in weather
conditions have a differential effect across exporting firms depending
on their size. While the average response of exports to increases in
temperature and precipitations is negative, this result hides an
important heterogeneity. Indeed, previously large exporters are
significantly and quantitatively less harmed than smaller ones when
facing the same shock. Elasticity of exports to temperatures and
precipitations are close to -0.3 for the smallest exporters but closer
to -0.1 for the largest ones. This feature is robust across countries
and relies on the within-country distribution of exporters.</p>
<p>These results are also robust to the use of alternative measures of
exports and firm size proxies. Results also resist to the inclusion of
many potential omitted variables, such as additional weather covariates
and other macroeconomic determinants of exports. Likewise, controlling
for product- and destination-specific shocks of the export flows does
not alter our results.</p>
<p>In the second part, we quantify the macroeconomic implications of
these firm-level responses and run counterfactual exercises measuring
the aggregate impact of future weather conditions on export outcomes.
Under a business-as-usual scenario, we find future weather conditions
would lower total exports in the countries of our sample by 9% on
average. This impact depends both on the firm-size distribution of
exporters in each country and on future climate conditions.</p>
<p>We further disentangle those two channels by studying two
counterfactuals: one where all countries face the same climate scenario,
and another where they share the same firm-size distribution. Our
results show that, under our counterfactual climate scenario, exports
losses in Burkina Faso would be 2.05 percentage points (p.p.) lower by
the end of the century. Likewise, if the country had the firm-size
distribution of Mexico (more large firms), the results show that export
losses would be 0.15 p.p. lower relative to the business-as usual. In
all, the exercise shows that while climate change will substantially
affect exports, differences in firm-size distribution can explain why
some countries can adapt better than others.</p>
<p>By documenting evidence on the links between temperature and firm
exports, this paper contributes to several strands of the literature.
Close to our paper, <span class="citation"
data-cites="jones2010climate"></span> estimate how the annual growth
rate of a country’s exports in a particular product category is affected
by the country’s weather. Estimates suggest an overall 2.2% decrease in
export growth in poor countries for each degree of temperature rise, and
no effect for precipitation. However, the analysis is done at the
aggregate level and does not highlight any heterogeneous firm effect,
contrary to what we do here. <span class="citation"
data-cites="karlsson2021temperature"></span> also studies how
temperature affects exports but do not highlight any firm size
heterogeneity and focuses on the United States. Other related works
include <span class="citation" data-cites="dallmann2019weather"></span>
which estimates a negative effect of temperature variations on total
trade and bilateral trade at the country level. While this level of
analysis is very informative, the results may suffer from aggregation
bias.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The existence of these bias calls
for an investigation at a more disaggregated level, as we do in this
paper.</p>
<p>By identifying heterogeneous firm effects, our paper also connects to
a trade literature documenting heterogeneous impacts of exogenous shocks
on firms’ trade outcomes and aggregate trade patterns.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
This work also echoes a general trend in the trade literature, based on
heterogeneous firms <span class="citation"
data-cites="bernard2007firms melitz2003impact"></span>, emphasizing the
non-straightforward links between micro-evidence and aggregate outcomes
<span class="citation"
data-cites="imbs2015elasticity costinot2020micro gaubert2021granular"></span>.</p>
<p>Finally, our paper is also connected to a large growing literature
documenting the effects of climate shocks on economic growth and on
other outcomes <span class="citation"
data-cites="hsiang2010temperatures dell2012temperature strobl13 delletal14 colmer2021"></span>,
at different levels of aggregation <span class="citation"
data-cites="burketanutama19 Damania2020 kalkuhl2020impact zhangetal18"></span>.
None of those studies focus on exporting firms in developing countries
as we do here.</p>
<p>Overall, our paper provides an explanation for some results present
in the literature. For instance, <span class="citation"
data-cites="jones2010climate"></span> show that poor countries exhibit
larger trade deterring effects of climate shocks than others. The lower
concentration of exports at the top of the firm-size distribution in
these countries could explain this result, provided that large firms are
less sensitive to weather shocks but account for a lower share of total
exports in poor countries. This feature could explain the aggregate
trade pattern and trade growth under temperature shocks. Our findings
also inform debates on the impact of climate on economic development
<span class="citation"
data-cites="nordhaus93 greenstone15 fleurbay18"></span>, and provide
insights about adaptation strategies in the tradable sector.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section
presents the data and summary statistics. Section <a href="#sec:micro"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:micro">3</a> provides the
results at the firm level, while Section <a href="#sec:aggregate"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:aggregate">4</a> draws the
aggregate implications of the micro-level results. Section <a
href="#sec:conclusion" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:conclusion">5</a> discusses the results and
concludes.</p>
<h3 id="sec:data">Data</h3>
<p>In this section, we detail our dataset combining firm-level exports
with information on climate conditions and other controls for each
country of our sample.</p>
<h6 id="firm-level-exports.">Firm-level exports.</h6>
<p>We use the exporter-level version of the Exporters Dynamics Database
<span class="citation" data-cites="Fernandes2016"></span>. This dataset
provides a collection of country-specific exporter-level customs
transactions made available to external researchers, under
confidentiality conditions. Our data covers the exports from 1993 to
2013. Our sample includes data on 9 LMIC: Burkina Faso, Guatemala,
Jordan, Mexico, Malawi, Peru, Senegal, Uruguay and Yemen. Within each
country, the dataset covers all export transactions at firm-HS6 product
- destination country -year dimension. Since the data come from customs
agencies, it covers export transactions only, and provides no
information on other firm characteristics, in particular firm location,
age, ownership, employment, or sales in the domestic market. The
available time span for each country is plot in Figure <a
href="#time_span" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="time_span">10</a>, in Appendix.</p>
<p>Regarding the export structure within each country of the sample,
Table <a href="#exports" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="exports">1</a> displays the average number of exporting
firms per year, the average export value in USD by firm, the first and
9th decile of exports per country, and the average number of HS6
products and destinations served by firms.</p>

<p>Our sample displays a large heterogeneity across countries in terms
of firm-size distribution: Mexico has around 100 times more exporters
than Malawi or Burkina Faso, and all trade margins are heterogeneous
across countries.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#relativeX" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="relativeX">1</a> digs further into the export structure.
Richer countries have more exporters, and within each country, the top
5% of exporters are much larger than the average exports than in
“poorer” countries. firm-size distributions are different across
countries, in particular, regarding the importance of the top firms.</p>

<p>We gather weather data from the Climatic Research Unit of the

data-cites="harris2014"></span>. This dataset is widely used in the

<p>In the main analysis, we use the yearly average of daily mean
temperatures and total monthly precipitations from this source. Figure
<a href="#fig:weather" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:weather">4</a> plots the total precipitations (<a

<p>To assess the robustness of our analysis, we will consider the
average minimum and maximum daily temperatures from the same source as
an alternative to daily mean temperature. Second, we will also use
humidity ("wet day frequency") as an alternative measure to
precipitations. Furthermore, in our robustness checks, we follow the
literature based on agronomy and convert daily mean temperatures into
degree days (DD) <span class="citation" data-cites="Hsiang2016"></span>
with thresholds of 32<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C and

<h3 id="sec:micro">Firm-level trade impact of local weather</h3>
<p>In this section, we first present our empirical strategy, then
display the results as well as several robustness checks.</p>
<h4 id="empirical-strategy">Empirical strategy</h4>
<p>To estimate the impact of weather variations on exports at the
firm-level, as well as its potentially differential effect across firms
of different sizes, we choose the following general specification: <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq:main-model}
        \begin{split}
            Exports_{ft} = \alpha Temp_{i(f)t} + \beta Prec_{it} +
\delta FirmSize_{ft-1} \\
            + \gamma \left(Temp_{i(f)t} \times FirmSize_{ft-1}\right) \\
            + \mu \left(Prec_{it} \times FirmSize_{ft-1}\right) \\
            + \xi Covariates_{it} + \{FE\} + \varepsilon_{ft},
        \end{split}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(Exports_{ft}\)</span> is the general measure of
export outcome for a firm <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in year
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The variables <span
class="math inline">\(Temp_{i(f)t}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Prec_{i(f)t}\)</span> denote temperature (in
Celsius) and precipitations (in millimeters) in country <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, where firm <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> operates, at year <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. We include the temperatures in levels
(hence providing a semi-elasicity of trade flows) and precipitations in
logs (providing an elasticity).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(FirmSize_{ft-1}\)</span> is a general
measure for firm size and is measured at the previous year <span
class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span> to avoid simultaneity with export
outcome in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Since we do not
have information about firms’ output, employment or any other outcomes,
we rely on the export outcomes to measure a firm’s size. Our baseline
measure is the lagged export values (in US$) at the firm-year level from
the Customs data. Total exports can proxy for firm size as exports and
firm outcomes are highly correlated <span class="citation"
data-cites="bernard2007firms"></span>. We will however test the
sensitivity of the results to the use of alternative proxies of firm
size.</p>
<p>To measure the differential effect of weather shocks across firms, we
include the interaction terms of temperature and precipitations with
<span class="math inline">\(FirmSize_{ft-1}\)</span>. These capture the
heterogeneous effect of a same variation in temperature or
precipitations on exports across firms of different sizes.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The model described in equation (<a href="#eq:main-model"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:main-model">[eq:main-model]</a>) also includes
country-year confounders, <span
class="math inline">\(Covariates_{it}\)</span>, that may explain export
outcomes at the firm level. These variables act as alternative
variables, potentially omitted, capturing economic and social context in
exporting countries: shocks to these variables could have an average
effect captured by the <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>
coefficient. In some specifications, we also interact it with firm size
to capture additional heterogeneous effects. Controlling for these other
time-varying variables allows us to isolate the strict effect of weather
variables. In practical terms, we include economic controls such as
exporting countries’ GDP in benchmark and further controls in
robustness. Our approach is thus consistent with gravity equations at
both the aggregate and the firm levels <span class="citation"
data-cites="head2014gravity"></span>.</p>
<p>To absorb unobserved heterogeneity, we include a set of fixed effects
<span class="math inline">\(\{FE\}\)</span> in equation (<a
href="#eq:main-model" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:main-model">[eq:main-model]</a>) that varies across
specifications. First, we consider a firm fixed effect to absorb
firm-specific time-invariant characteristics affecting exports. For
instance, it could be a firm’s specialization across products, its
management strategy, the average (over time) skills of its labor force,
whether it is a multinational firm, <em>etc</em>. As no firm changes of
origin country, this fixed effect controls for the origin country as
well, and absorbs for instance initial differences between climate
conditions across countries.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Our sample is slightly
affected by this inclusion as we have to drop firms that appear only 1
year in the sample. Second, we include a (HS2) sector-year set of fixed
effects: it allows to compare exporters in the same sector-year, and
more generally to absorb common shocks faced by exporters<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.
Third, in some specifications, we also include a (HS2)
sector-country-year fixed effect, for unobserved heterogeneity across
sector-countries in the sample. This fixed effect controls for all
pre-existing differences in the specialization of countries across types
of products and industries, as well as for differences in the level of
development across countries. It also absorbs the differences across
countries in average weather conditions and other aggregate covariates.
Further, this fixed effect holds constant the total exports of the HS2
sector from each country-year period. As a result, in this
specification, the identifying variation in our exercise is across firms
all belonging to the same sector-country and thus face the same weather
shocks.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ft}\)</span> is a
random error term capturing all omitted factors, which we allow to be
heteroskedastic and correlated across HS2 sectors and years. In all our
regressions we report the standard errors clustered at the HS2
sector-country-year level.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h6 id="trade-margins-dependent-variables-and-estimators.">Trade
margins, dependent variables and estimators.</h6>
<p>At the intensive margin, the export outcome is the level of exports
at the firm level, <span class="math inline">\(X_{ft}\)</span>. When
estimating this equation, we use a linear estimator and a log
specification for exports. We thus focus only on positive export flows
at the firm level. Our preferred measure of exports is the exported
values (in US$). At the extensive margin, the export outcomes are the
number of HS6 products and the number of destinations served by a firm,
following <span class="citation"
data-cites="RePEc:nbr:nberwo:16641"></span>.</p>
<h4 id="results">Results</h4>
<p>In this section, we start by providing results for the intensive
margin and then for the extensive one. We then turn to several
robustness checks, focusing on potential omitted variables and product-
and destination-specific shocks.</p>
<p class="heading" id="baseline-results-intensive-margin.">Baseline
results: intensive margin.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#results_intensive" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="results_intensive">[results_intensive]</a> presents the
benchmark estimation of equation (<a href="#eq:main-model"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="eq:main-model">[eq:main-model]</a>) at the intensive
margin. The dependent variable is the log of exports, and we gradually
add interaction terms and fixed-effect specifications.</p>
<p>Looking at column 1, we see that increases in temperatures and in
precipitations decrease average firm-level exports. This specification
provides the average, firm-level exports response to weather covariates,
controlling for aggregate, country-wide trade determinants GDP and
lagged firm export outcome. Since we have included a firm fixed effect,
identification comes from exports variations across years for a given
firm.</p>
<p>On average, past exports and GDP also play a role in to explain the
variation in the value of exports. We estimate that a 1<span
class="math inline">\(\degree\)</span>C increase in temperatures
decreases exports by around 5.6 % on average, whereas a 1% increase in
total precipitations is associated with a decrease of 0.3 %.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This set of average weather effects on exports hides significant
heterogeneity across firms. Columns 2, 3, and 4 examine how firm-size
(measured by lagged firm exports) shapes the influence of temperature
and precipitations on exports. Results show that increases in
precipitations have some heterogeneous effects across firms. We always
estimate a positive and significant interaction between precipitations
and lagged firm exports, independently of the set of fixed effects
included in specifications. Larger firms reduce less their exports
compared to smaller firms, conditional on precipitation changes.</p>
<p>We find the same pattern regarding temperatures. Larger exporters are
less harmed by changes in temperatures than smaller exporters. Point
estimates are however naturally smaller as the temperatures enter in
levels in the models. We hence estimate semi-elasticities.</p>
<p>In column 4, we introduce a country-sector-year fixed effect,
absorbing the unconditional effect of weather shocks, and controlling
for all country-wide shocks. This change in specification does not
affect our conclusions.</p>
<p>Overall, in all instances, although the unconditional effect of the
weather shock is negative, we observe that the interaction terms between
weather and firm size are positive and statistically significant. This
suggests that both temperature and precipitation shocks decrease
firm-level exports, but that this effect decreases with firm size.</p>
<p class="heading"
id="quantification-of-the-differential-effects.">Quantification of the
differential effects.</p>
<p>How much do these differences across firms matter? Figure <a
href="#quantification" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="quantification">5</a> plots the country-by-country
expected exports response of firms belonging to the bottom and top 5%,
bottom 10%, top 5% and top 10% for a one standard deviation increase in
temperatures (Panel A) and in precipitations (Panel B). These results
are based on the third column of Table <a href="#results_intensive"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="results_intensive">[results_intensive]</a>.</p>
<p>For a given temperature variation, for every country of our sample,
the bottom 5% of firm-size distribution is disproportionally and
negatively affected relative to the top 5%. In Mexico or Uruguay the
smallest firms are almost three times more affected than the largest
ones.</p>
<p>This differential effect of weather across firms is even more
pronounced regarding the impact of precipitations. Estimates in Panel B
suggest that the top firms’ exports are almost left unaffected by the
shock, while exports are very deterred for small exporters. The effect
is -0.4% for the 5% of the top firm-size distribution in Mexico, while
it is -0.5% for the bottom 5%.</p>
<p>Eventually, note that this feature is robust across countries, even
though the magnitude of the differential effect appears heterogeneous.
Finally, note also that even though point estimates of temperatures and
precipitation are not of the same magnitude in the tables, their
quantitative implications are very close in size.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:deciles" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:deciles">8</a> checks where, in the distribution,
the differential effect of weather across firms comes from. Whereas our
baseline interaction coefficient provides an average measure of the
effect of firm size on the elasticity, we allow this elasticity to vary
non-linearly, along firm-size distribution. We estimate the following
model: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:decile}
    \begin{split}
        Exports_{ft} = \alpha Temp_{i(f)t} + \delta Covariates_{it} +
\newline
        \sum_{d=1}^{10} \beta_d \mathbbm{1}[Decile_{ft-1} =d] \\ +
\sum_{d=1}^{10} \gamma_d ( \mathbbm{1}[Decile_{ft-1} =d] \times
Weather_{i(f)t}) + FE + \varepsilon_{ft}
    \end{split}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbbm{1}[Decile_{ft-1} =d]\)</span> is a set of
dummy variables for each decile <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
in the lagged exports distribution, and where <span
class="math inline">\(Weather_{i(f)t}\)</span> is temperatures and
precipitations.</p>

class="math inline">\(\gamma_d\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(d=\{2, ..., 10\}\)</span>, as the first decile is
the reference group. Compared to the smallest firms, export growth is
increased throughout the firm-size distribution. Besides, the
differential effect of weather shocks across firms appears to be linear
along firm size. The (implicitly linear) interaction coefficient in our
estimation is thus a good approximation of the differential effect
across firms.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#t_extensive" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="t_extensive">[t_extensive]</a> replicates the analysis
for the extensive margin of trade, still at the firm-level. We estimate
the impact of weather shocks on the log number of HS6 products exported
to any destinations (columns 1, 2 and 3), and on the log number of
destinations served (columns 4 to 6). We follow <span class="citation"
data-cites="RePEc:nbr:nberwo:16641"></span> and consider that, on top of
the intensive margin, exporters choose presence at export destination
and product scope. In theory, these two measures capture the extensive
margin of trade as expanding product scope and serving additional
markets requires the payment of additional fixed costs. The inability to
cover for these costs leads some firms to exit foreign market and/or
reduce their product scope, which can be seen as firm selection.</p>

<p>Results displayed in Table <a href="#t_extensive"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="t_extensive">[t_extensive]</a>
suggest that weather shocks deter both measures of the extensive margin
of trade (columns 1-2 and 4-5), as for the intensive margin. Again, firm
size dampens this negative effect, in particular for precipitations. The
interaction with lagged firm exports systematically lower the effect of
weather shocks across our specifications.</p>
<p>The interaction term with temperatures is significant at the 10%
level in column 3, but becomes non significant and with value zero in
the other specifications.</p>
<p>The overall magnitude of the effects is smaller than for the
intensive margin (see Table <a href="#results_intensive"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="results_intensive">[results_intensive]</a>). The
unconditional effects of weather conditions are around 50% lower for
precipitations, and decreased by 20% for temperatures. The differential
effects we identify for precipitations are much smaller than at the
intensive margin.</p>
<h4 id="robustness-analysis">Robustness analysis</h4>
<p>Temperature and precipitation shocks deter exports at both intensive
and extensive trade margins. This effect, in both cases, is dampened by
firms’ size. This is the core result of our paper. The dampening effect
of firms’ size appears to be quantitatively more important at the
intensive margin (compared to the unconditional effect). As a result,
most of the differential adjustment to weather shocks appears to be
occurring at the intensive margin. For this reason, we mainly focus our
robustness checks on this dimension. In this section, we assess the
robustness of our results to variables’ measures, omitted variables as
well as product and destination shocks.</p>

<p>First, Table <a href="#t_Rtemp" data-reference-type="ref"

significance of our main coefficients of interest. Column 4 also shows
that results are unaffected when using the number of wet days
(’humidity’) as an alternative to precipitations.</p>

In Table <a href="#R_firmsize" data-reference-type="ref"

of exporter size (as an alternative to lagged exports) and include their
interactions with weather variables. We consider the 1-year and 2-year

of firm size. The interaction coefficients are significant, positive and
close in point estimates.</p>

shocks across firms. Table <a href="#t_omitted"

class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(t-1\)</span> and in <span
class="math inline">\(t-2\)</span>, in the specification and shows that
our main coefficient does not capture the differential effect of
previous weather shocks. Column 2 controls for the differential effect
of tariffs dynamics, without affecting the estimated interaction
coefficient. In columns 3 and 4, we use the data from <span
class="citation" data-cites="dahlberg2018quality"></span> to test the
impact of changes in the quality of governance in exporting countries.
Column 3 estimates the differential trade effects of weather controlling
for changes in the "Voice and Accountability" measure, while in column 4
we control for the government effectiveness and for political stability.
The sample size is affected but we still estimate a positive and
significant coefficient of weather and firm size, confirming our
benchmark estimation. Notice that the point estimate is slightly higher
here. Finally, weather shocks could be correlated to changes in the
economic environment of firms, and thus access to credit. Changes in
domestic credit (as a share of GDP) in column 5 and changes in the
number of banks in column 6 indeed have a differential effect across
firms, but it does not alter our main conclusion: weather shocks have a
differential impact across firms, in favor of larger firms.</p>
<p class="heading"
id="product-specific-and-destination-specific-shocks">Product-specific
and destination-specific shocks</p>
<p>Export patterns at the firm level are also determined by
product-specific shocks such as changes in tastes, and by
destinations-specific shifts such as varying GDP. Here we test the
robustness of our results when accounting for such possible shocks.
Suppose for instance that weather shocks in country <span
class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c_2\)</span> are correlated, and that <span
class="math inline">\(c_2\)</span> imports goods from <span
class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span>. Following these weather shocks, part
of our main result could come from changes in <span
class="math inline">\(c_2\)</span> imports that, in turn, affect exports
in <span class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span>. Cross-country correlation
of weather shocks is thus a potential challenge in our case. To
neutralize these issues, we estimate the following specification, using
export information at the firm-destination-product level: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{split}
        Exports_{fjpt} = \alpha Weather_{i(f)t} + \beta Exports_{ft-1} +
\delta Covariates_{it} + \nu Shocks_{jt} \\ + \gamma ( Weather_{i(f)t}
\times Exports_{ft-1} ) + \mu (Covariates_{it} \times Exports_{ft-1} )
\\ + \eta ( Shocks_{jt} \times Exports_{ft-1} )+ FE + \varepsilon_{ft}

denotes the destination market, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
denotes the HS6 product category. <span
class="math inline">\(Shock_{jt}\)</span> captures destination-specific
aggregate shocks that may have both an average effect on exports and a
differential effect across exporting firms. We include a set of fixed
effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity, combining firm-,
product-, sector- and destination- effects. Both these combinations of
product- and destination-specific fixed effects and the inclusion of
destination-year macroeconomic control variables allows us to absorb
competing mechanisms, and we cluster the standard errors at the origin-
HS2 sector-year level. Results are displayed in Table <a
href="#t_destinations" data-reference-type="ref"

<p>Column 1 shows that temperatures in home country do not deter the
average exports at the intensive margin once accounting for destination
temperatures and GDP. Yet, precipitation at home still deter exports on
average. Column 2 however supports this average effects hide
heterogeneity across local firms: larger firms are less negatively
affected by temperature and precipitations shocks at home, even when
controlling for home and foreign aggregate shifts in GDP and trade
determinants. Columns 3 to 4 further support that the differential
effect of local temperature shocks holds when taking into account the
potential differential effect of foreign weather shocks and foreign
macroeconomic shocks (and by including demanding fixed effects). The
interaction term is only slightly affected, without any change in its
significance. The coefficient is stable across specifications, which
reinforces confidence in the estimation and in the model we estimate.
Overall, whereas cross-country correlation of weather shocks could
explain our results, we show that this is not the case. This confirms
the differential effect previously estimated at the firm-year
dimension.</p>

that allows to capture the differential effect. The major part of the
cross-firm variance in the heterogeneous reaction to temperatures is
accounted for by lagged exports.</p>

id="heterogeneity-effects-across-sectors">Heterogeneity: Effects across
sectors</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:sectors" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:sectors">14</a> shows the estimated differential
impact of weather variations on exports across broad sectors. Firm-level
exports were aggregated by HS2 (chapter) and then by broad sector. Our
results imply that all sectors exhibit some differential effects across
firms: firms within a sector are heterogeneously affected by
precipitation, and to a lesser extent by temperature variations. Indeed,
whereas most sectors yield a differential pattern after precipitation
changes, the differential impact of temperatures across firms is limited
to a small set of sectors.</p>
<p class="heading" id="firms-sorting">Firms sorting</p>
<p>Finally, larger firms could cluster in areas facing more stable
temperatures relative to rural regions where temperature variations
could be higher. We note however that it is unlikely to affect our
results for at least two reasons. On the one hand, we use year-to-year
changes in weather and exports, which limits the potential sorting
pattern in space. On the other hand, even in the presence of potential
sorting with all exporters moving to milder areas, it would imply in the
longer run that workers would also move to these areas. As we rely on
aggregated country-year information (i.e. daily station level data, with
transformations and aggregation by country), our data captures this
potential within-country variation in economic activity.</p>
<h3 id="sec:aggregate">Aggregate Implications</h3>
<p>In this section, we explore the aggregate implications of the
micro-level results presented previously. We build on the approach
developed by <span class="citation" data-cites="di2018micro"></span> and
adapted to a trade and environment setting by papers such as <span
class="citation" data-cites="hericourt2018multi"></span> or <span
class="citation" data-cites="erbahar2019two"></span>.</p>
<p>In section <a href="#sec:micro" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:micro">3</a>, we identified the heterogeneous
firm-specific elasticity of exports to weather shocks: larger firms
exhibit smaller negative responses. It follows that aggregate
country-wide exports should be deterred to the extent that exports are
realized by numerous smaller firms, which are particularly harmed by
precipitations and temperatures shocks.</p>
<p>We empirically investigate this intuition here by performing a set of
counterfactual exercises relative to both climate scenarios and the
structure of exports. We conduct projections of future exports when all
countries face the same changes in climate conditions, and then when
they share the same firm-distribution. This allows us disentangle the
importance of climate and firm-size effects, as we detail below.</p>
<h4 id="data-sources-and-sample">Data sources and sample</h4>
<p>In this exercise, we use additional data from the Climate Knowledge
Portal from the World Bank. Data consist of predicted temperatures <span
class="math inline">\(T^{exp}_{i,t}\)</span> and precipitation <span
class="math inline">\(P^{exp}_{i,t}\)</span> for each country in our
sample at the yearly level up to 2100, i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(t \in \{2015,\cdots, 2100\}\)</span>. For each
country-year, several indicators are available: we use the projections
from the HadGEM3-GC3.1 for CMIP6 model and two climate scenarios, from
the most pessimistic (RCP 8.5) to the most optimistic (RCP 2.6).<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Figure <a href="#fig:predictions_weather"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:predictions_weather">13</a> in Appendix, we plot the
precipitations (a) and temperatures (b) projections for each country
over time for the two climate scenarios (dark or light orange). The
RCP8.5 scenario predicts important differences in temperature increases
relative to the most optimistic scenario. For instance, in Malawi, the
average temperature is expected to increase by 6<span
class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C at the end of the century under
the RCP8.5 scenario, while it is expected to increase by 1.5<span
class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C under the RCP2.6 scenario. For
precipitations, the differences are less pronounced, but still
important.</p>
<h4 id="sec:predexports">Country-specific predicted exports</h4>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:predicted_exports" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:predicted_exports">9</a> plots the predicted
exports, derived from our empirical model (column 3 of Table <a
href="#results_intensive" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="results_intensive">[results_intensive]</a>), when
observed weather conditions are replaced by predicted weather
conditions. The firm-specific responses were aggregated by decile of
size (measured by lagged exports) under the RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios.
Taking this aggregation by country-year yields the total exports
patterns over time (<span class="math inline">\(t \in \{ 2015, ... ,
2100 \}\)</span>) for each country. Future exports were normalized by
the initial level of exports, <em>i.e.</em> the latest aggregate exports
available in our sample. Figure <a href="#fig:predicted_exports"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:predicted_exports">9</a>
hence displays the relative change in exports over time.</p>
<div class="center">
<figure id="fig:predicted_exports">
<embed src="Figs/Predicted_exports.pdf" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption>Predicted exports</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Several patterns emerge. First, the amount of exports decreases over
time in the 7 countries represented here. Second, the effects are much
more important under the most pessimistic scenario. Indeed, with RCP 8.5
it is estimated that exports would decline by 10% because of new weather
conditions. This is an average effect across the countries. On the
contrary, the most optimistic scenario yields only relatively marginal
export losses. Third, there are strong differences between trajectories
across countries. For example, exports losses are larger in Malawi than
in Uruguay. This differential pattern across countries is valid for both
climate scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="counterfactual-exercises">Counterfactual exercises</h4>
<p>Two main forces could be driving the differential export patterns
described in section <a href="#sec:predexports"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:predexports">4.2</a>. On
the one hand, countries face different changes in weather conditions
over time. For instance, changes in temperatures and in precipitations
could be larger in some parts of the world, affecting more the exports
of some countries compared to others, independently of their structure
of exports.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the structure of exports differ between countries:
the importance of large firms – which are less harmed by weather shocks
– varies between countries. The differential composition of firms in the
economy hence generates different patterns of exports under weather
shocks.</p>
<p>To shed light on the quantitative importance of these two channels,
we perform three counterfactual exercises. First, we replicate the
analysis from section <a href="#sec:predexports"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:predexports">4.2</a>, but
considering that all countries in the sample face the same, average
change in climate conditions. It means that we build a counterfactual
weather scenario that is equal to the average of the 7 country-specific
RCP8.5 scenarios. This exercise shuts down the differential climate
change effect, and considers that all countries in our sample face the
same weather changes from one year to the next one.</p>
<p>Second, we go back to the country-specific projected changes in
weather conditions (as in section <a href="#sec:predexports"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:predexports">4.2</a>), but
this time we impose an alternative firm-distribution: all countries have
the Mexico firm distribution. As shown in Figure <a href="#relativeX"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="relativeX">1</a>, Mexico has a
larger firm concentration compared to other countries. In that sense,
Mexico can be viewed as relatively polar case. This exercise shuts down
the firm distribution differential across countries.</p>

<p>Column "CF1" provides the predictions of our model when all countries
face the counterfactual change in weather, which is the average of the 6
countries. Unsurprisingly, the countries that are more exposed to
adverse future weather shocks would lose less by facing milder weather
conditions. This is particularly the case for Malawi and Burkina Faso.
On the contrary, countries that are expected to face milder weather
change over time would lose more if they were to face adverse weather in
the medium and long runs, as Uruguay or Guatemala for instance.</p>
<p>In this counterfactual, results are driven by the relative inequality
between countries to face adverse weather conditions. Examining the
bottom of the table, we see that removing these inequalities reduces the
dispersion of exports response across countries. However, we also
estimate that the average costs in terms of reduced exports would be
larger in that case, compared to BAU.</p>
<h6 id="countries-have-the-same-firm-distribution-cf2.">Countries have
the same firm-distribution (CF2). </h6>
<p>Column "CF2" shows the results when all countries face their own
country-specific changes in weather, but that firm distribution in each
country is the one from Mexico. Compared to the BAU case, most countries
would benefit from having Mexico’s firm distribution. This is direct
consequence of our empirical results, suggesting that the negative
aggregate impact of weather shock (in the past or in the future) is
inversely related to the importance of large exporters, that are less
affected by adverse weather conditions. In CF2, we observe for instance
that export losses due to climate change would be 0.15 p.p. lower in
Burkina Faso if the country had Mexico’s structure of exports. In
Uruguay, it would be 0.8 p.p. lower.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the table, we provide two aggregates of importance.
For each counterfactual, we provide the average export loss and its
dispersion across countries. Two main results can be identified from our
analysis. On the one hand, considering average weather conditions
(instead of the country-specific projected weather) would yield lower
dispersion of exports loss across countries but larger average costs. On
the other hand, changing firm distribution reduces both aggregate/mean
exports loss under climate change and dispersion across countries,
though to a smaller extent.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="heading" id="limits.">Limits.</p>
<p>As for any exercise, our quantification presents some limitations.
First, it is based on partial elasticities, not structural estimations.
Our estimations absorb global, common shocks (in our set of
fixed-effects) and identify effects compared to average sectoral values.
This means that our counterfactuals ignore, for instance, possible
variations in global demand or sector-specific environmental disasters
that would affect exports in the context of climate change. Second, our
quantification exercise assumes constant firm-size distribution. In
fact, future weather conditions may affect this distribution as, for
example, smaller firms are disproportionately impacted. While this is
beyond the scope of this paper, we think that a similar exercise
considering endogenous firm-size distribution would be a promising
research avenue.</p>
<h3 id="sec:conclusion">Concluding remarks</h3>
<p>In this paper, we analyze the impact of weather shocks on firm-level
exports in 9 LMIC. For this purpose, we combined temperature and
precipitations data with various information on exporting firms. Our
main identification strategy uses year-to-year fluctuations in weather
conditions, as well as country, year and sector fixed-effects.</p>
<p>In the first part of our analysis, we find differential effects of
increases in temperature and precipitations across exporting firms
depending on their size. While the average response of exports to these
weather covariates are negative, this result hides a large
heterogeneity: large exporters are significantly and quantitatively less
harmed than smaller ones. Elasticity of exports to temperatures and
precipitations are close to -0.3 for the smallest exporters but closer
to -0.1 for the largest ones. This feature is robust across countries
and relies on the within-country distribution of firms.</p>
<p>In the second part of our analysis, we investigate how this
micro-level impacts influence aggregate exporting outcomes. While we
estimate that future climate conditions will decrease aggregate exports
by 9% on average in our sample, we find that firm-size distribution
plays an important role in mitigating this result. Indeed, in a
counterfactual exercise, we show that if all countries had the firm-size
distribution of Mexico (the country with the largest share of top
exporters in our sample), then the negative average impact of climate
change would be 0.13 p.p. lower than under business-as-usual. In some
countries, like Burkina Faso, it is 0.15 p.p. lower. Overall, this
simple exercise highlights that expanding the role of large firms in the
economy reduces the costs of future climate shifts on aggregate exports.
This is the second important result of this paper.</p>
<p>Given the importance of future climate trends, our results suggest
that firm-size distribution in low- and middle-income countries,
characterized by a lower share of large exporters, could increase the
aggregate cost of climate shocks on trade. In that sense, increasing
firm concentration could be beneficial as climate adaptation is
seemingly less costly for top exporters. Additionally, we note that more
exports from top firms might, in theory, bring important general
equilibrium effects not necessarily linked to environmental conditions.
One example is the reallocation of labor from low to high-productive
firms, allowing significant productivity gains. While this paper did not
focus specifically on these implications, we believe this kind of
analysis in an integrated aggregate framework to be an important
research avenue. Especially in the context of climate change, which
makes these questions even more challenging.</p>

averaged temperatures at the weather station - country -day dimensions
(for our sample countries, this represents around 19 000 000
observations). We have aggregated that data by computing the daily
average temperature by country. Armed with these country <span

<span class="math inline">\(T_{idt}\)</span>, we have converted them

<p><span class="math display">\[\text{DD}_{it} = \left\{

which captures both the number of days of “large temperatures” and a
cumulative measure of these “large temperatures”.</p>

close to zero precipitations in many of the coming years, according to
the World Bank data. Given the following exercises, we had to exclude
those two countries from our sample for this part of the analysis, as
withdrawing the common precipitation variation (for all countries) from
the close-to-zero precipitation leads to biased measures. To be
consistent in this section, we always run the models on a restricted
sample, without Jordan and Yemen.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back"
